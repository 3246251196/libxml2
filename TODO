           TODO for the XML parser and stuff:
	   ==================================

TODO:
=====

- extend validity checks to go through entities content instead of
  just labelling them PCDATA
- add support for the trick from Henry conf/sun/valid/empty.xml
- Correct standalone checking/emitting (hard)
  2.9 Standalone Document Declaration
- URI checkings (no fragments) rfc2396.txt
- Better checking of external parsed entities TAG 1234
- Find way of representing PERefs in the Dtd so that %entity; can
  be saved back.
- Go through erratas and do the cleanup.

TODO:
=====

- Get OASIS testsuite to a more friendly result, check all the results
  once stable.
  http://xmlsoft.org/conf/result.html

- Optimization of tag strings allocation ?

- maintain coherency of namespace when doing cut'n paste operations
  => the functions are coded, but need testing

- function to rebuild the ID table
- functions to rebuild the DTD hash tables (after DTD changes).


   

EXTENSIONS:
===========

- Check attribute normalization especially xmlGetProp()
- Validity checking problems for NOTATIONS attributes
- Validity checking problems for ENTITY ENTITIES attributes
- dynamically adapt the alloc entry point to use g_alloc()/g_free()
  if the programmer wants it: 
    - use xmlMemSetup() to reset the routines used.
- Parsing of a well balanced chunk
- URI module: validation, base, etc ...
- Tools to produce man pages from the SGML docs.
- Finish XPath
  => attributes addressing troubles
  => defaulted attributes handling
  => namespace axis ?

- Add Xpointer recognition/API

- Add Xlink recognition/API
  => started adding an xlink.[ch] with a unified API for XML and HTML.

- Implement XSLT
  => seems that someone volunteered ?!?

- Implement XSchemas

- O2K parsing;
  => this is a somewhat ugly mix of HTML and XML, adding a specific
     routine in the comment parsing code of HTML and plug the XML 
     parsing one in-there should not be too hard. Key point is to get
     XSL to transform all this to something decent ...

- extend the shell with:
   - edit
   - load/save
   - mv (yum, yum, but it's harder because directories are ordered in
     our case, mvup and mvdown would be required)

- Add HTML validation using the XHTML DTD
  - problem: do we want to keep and maintain the code for handling
    DTD/System ID cache directly in libxml ?

- Add a DTD cache prefilled with xhtml DTDs and entities and a program to
  manage them -> like the /usr/bin/install-catalog from SGML
  right place seems $datadir/xmldtds

- turn tester into a generic program xml-test installed with xml-devel

- Add output to XHTML in case of HTML documents.


Done:
=====

- Save Dtds using the children list instead of dumping the tables,
  order is preserved as well as comments and PIs
- Wrote a notice of changes requires to go from 1.x to 2.x
- make sure that all SAX callbacks are disabled if a WF error is detected
- checking/handling of newline normalization
  http://localhost/www.xml.com/axml/target.html#sec-line-ends
- correct checking of '&' '%' on entities content.
- checking of PE/Nesting on entities declaration
- checking/handling of xml:space
   - checking done.
   - handling done, not well tested
- Language identification code, productions [33] to [38]
  => done, the check has been added and report WFness errors
- Conditional sections in DTDs [61] to [65]
  => should this crap be really implemented ???
  => Yep OASIS testsuite uses them
- Allow parsed entities defined in the internal subset to override
  the ones defined in the external subset (DtD customization).
  => This mean that the entity content should be computed only at
     use time, i.e. keep the orig string only at parse time and expand
     only when referenced from the external subset :-(
     Needed for complete use of most DTD from Eve Maler
- Add regression tests for all WFC errors
  => did some in test/WFC
  => added OASIS testsuite routines
     http://xmlsoft.org/conf/result.html

- I18N: http://wap.trondheim.com/vaer/index.phtml is not XML and accepted
  by the XML parser, UTF-8 should be checked when there is no "encoding"
  declared !
- Support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding
  => added some convertion routines provided by Martin Durst
     patched them, got fixes from @@@
     I plan to keep everything internally as UTF-8 (or ISO-Latin-X)
     this is slightly more costly but more compact, and recent processors
     efficiency is cache related. The key for good performances is keeping
     the data set small, so will I.
  => the new progressive reading routines call the detection code
     is enabled, tested the ISO->UTF-8 stuff
- External entities loading: 
   - allow override by client code
   - make sure it is alled for all external entities referenced
  Done, client code should use xmlSetExternalEntityLoader() to set
  the default loading routine. It will be called each time an external
  entity entity resolution is triggered.
- maintain ID coherency when removing/changing attributes
  The function used to deallocate attributes now check for it being an
  ID and removes it from the table.
- push mode parsing i.e. non-blocking state based parser
  done, both for XML and HTML parsers. Use xmlCreatePushParserCtxt()
  and xmlParseChunk() and html counterparts.
  The tester program now has a --push option to select that parser 
  front-end. Douplicated tests to use both and check results are similar.

- Most of XPath, still see some troubles and occasionnal memleaks.
- an XML shell, allowing to traverse/manipulate an XML document with
  a shell like interface, and using XPath for the anming syntax
  - use of readline and history added when available
  - the shell interface has been cleanly separated and moved to debugXML.c
- HTML parser, should be fairly stable now
- API to search the lang of an attribute
- Collect IDs at parsing and maintain a table. 
   PBM: maintain the table coherency
   PBM: how to detect ID types in absence of DtD !
- Use it for XPath ID support
- Add validity checking
  Should be finished now !
- Add regression tests with entity substitutions

- External Parsed entities, either XML or external Subset [78] and [79]
  parsing the xmllang DtD now works, so it should be sufficient for
  most cases !

- progressive reading. The entity support is a first step toward
  asbtraction of an input stream. A large part of the context is still
  located on the stack, moving to a state machine and putting everyting
  in the parsing context should provide an adequate solution.
  => Rather than progressive parsing, give more power to the SAX-like
     interface. Currently the DOM-like representation is built but
     => it should be possible to define that only as a set of SAX callbacks
	and remove the tree creation from the parser code.
	DONE

- DOM support, instead of using a proprietary in memory
  format for the document representation, the parser should
  call a DOM API to actually build the resulting document.
  Then the parser becomes independent of the in-memory
  representation of the document. Even better using RPC's
  the parser can actually build the document in another
  program.
  => Work started, now the internal representation is by default
     very near a direct DOM implementation. The DOM glue is implemented
     as a separate module. See the GNOME gdome module.

- C++ support : John Ehresman <jehresma@dsg.harvard.edu>
- Updated code to follow more recent specs, added compatibility flag
- Better error handling, use a dedicated, overridable error
  handling function.
- Support for CDATA.
- Keep track of line numbers for better error reporting.
- Support for PI (SAX one).
- Support for Comments (bad, should be in ASAP, they are parsed
  but not stored), should be configurable.
- Improve the support of entities on save (+SAX).
