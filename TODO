           TODO for the XML parser:

- use libunicode !
- finish XPath, then XPointer, Xlink
- Support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding (Urgent !!!).
- progressive parsing. The entity support is a first step toward
  asbtraction of an input stream. A large part of the context is still
  located on the stack, moving to a state machine and putting everyting
  in the parsing context should provide an adequate solution.

Done:
- Improve the support for SAX
- C++ support : John Ehresman <jehresma@dsg.harvard.edu>
- Updated code to follow more recent specs, added compatibility flag
- Better error handling, use a dedicated, overridable error
  handling function.
- Support for CDATA.
- Keep track of line numbers for better error reporting.
- Support for PI (SAX one).
