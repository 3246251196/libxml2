NOTE: 
  - the head of this module is package libxml-2 . There is incompatibilities
    with the old libxml-1 headers. I posted on gnome-hackers a recipe to
    change your code to compile with both, check it out ! Also read
    http://xmlsoft.org/upgrade.html
  - in the meantime the old 1.x code has been tagged with LIB_XML_1_X
    extract this version and drop me a mail if you want me to take care of
    the update of your module to libxml-2 <veillard@w3.org>

     Rules for commits on the gnome-xml module
     =========================================

If what you are patching is a non-compilation issue either at compile
time or linking time on one of the main Linux platforms, then feel free
to patch first and send mail afterward.

Otherwise, send me (Daniel.Veillard@w3.org) a mail and if it's a bug
issue, register it at bugs.gnome.org. I check both my mail and the
bug database everyday. if you don't get an answer within 3 days
(which is highly unprobable) then commit your changes. This simply
mean that I'm on holliday or on the road.

The reasons I'm asking for an ask before commit policy is that I'm
using a separate CVS base for unstable developments and if you commit
a patch I didn't get, I may loose your change by mistake (it happened
already once) and seriously complicates my job of merging both bases.
(The second base is at http://dev.w3.org/ under the XML module).

  thanks in advance for following the rule,

Daniel

P.S.: Raph Levien get an exception for the send before commit rule :-)
