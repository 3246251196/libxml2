             TODO for the libxml2 Python wrappers

         $Id$

Things to do:
-------------

- SAX interfaces
- enums -> libxml.py
- access to XPath variables
- xmlBuffer exposure
- xpathContext, being able to set/get info and clean it up
- add regression tests
   - build tree
   - saving
   - SAX flow


Done:
-----
- class hierarchy:
  + make specific node type inherit from xmlNode
    done, had to sort the classes in the output
  + get the generator to output a classes.txt description
    done libxml2class.txt
- add regression tests
   - tests/Makefile.am: export the Python class path
   - xpath queries
   - xpath extension
   - check memory
- extensions based on a python.xml description of the new specific
  interfaces
   file libxml2-python-api.xml , first entry is xmlRegisterXPathFunction
- spec file: automatically generate for pythonX.Y if found
  Done, a bit ugly by running new makes in %install for each level
  found.
- error redirections and preformat
- handling of node.content
- access to xmlParserCtxt and push mode
   - needed for SAX too
   - entry points
   - wrappers
   - decent interface for setting/getting behaviour
- memory debug interfaces
