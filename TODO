           TODO for the XML parser:

- Support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding (Urgent !!!).
- progressive parsing. The entity support is a first step toward
  asbtraction of an input stream. A large part of the context is still
  located on the stack, moving to a state machine and putting everyting
  in the parsing context should provide an adequate solution.
- DOM support, instead of using a proprietary in memory
  format for the document representation, the parser should
  call a DOM API to actually build the resulting document.
  Then the parser becomes independent of the in-memory
  representation of the document. Even better using RPC's
  the parser can actually build the document in another
  program.
- Support for Comments (bad, should be in ASAP, they are parsed
  but not stored), should be configurable.
- Improve the support of entities on save (+SAX).

Done:
- C++ support : John Ehresman <jehresma@dsg.harvard.edu>
- Updated code to follow more recent specs, added compatibility flag
- Better error handling, use a dedicated, overridable error
  handling function.
- Support for CDATA.
- Keep track of line numbers for better error reporting.
- Support for PI (SAX one).
