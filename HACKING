     Rules for commits on the gnome-xml version 1 branch
     ===================================================

I don't use v1 much anymore, and the Gnome folks are the main
users of this version. Feel free to patch, commit and send me mail
when you find a bug and need it fixed.

  Please don't do that for the Head, and check the HACKING file
in HEAD for related instructions,

  thanks in advance,

Daniel
