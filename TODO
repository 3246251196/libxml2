           TODO for the XML parser:

- Support for UTF-8 encoding
- progressive parsing. Currently the parser uses a single
  string containing the full document. The good point is
  that there is no context associated with the parser, the
  full state is in the stack. The bad point is that such a
  recursive design is hard to make progressive ...
- Better error handling, use a dedicated, overridable error
  handling function.
- Keep track of line numbers for better error reporting.
- DOM support, instead of using a proprietary in memory
  format for the document representation, the parser should
  call a DOM API to actually build the resulting document.
  Then the parser becomes independent of the in-memory
  representation of the document. Even better using RPC's
  the parser can actually build the document in another
  program.
- finish the support for Entities.
- Support for Comments (bad, should be in ASAP, they are parsed
  but not stored).
- Support for PI.
- Support for CDATA.

Done:
- C++ support : John Ehresman <jehresma@dsg.harvard.edu>
- Updated code to follow more recent specs, added compatibility flag
