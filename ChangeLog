Sun Oct 18 15:08:19 EDT 1998 Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* tree.c : make sure that the type id is properly set-up when
	  a new object is allocated, needed for DOM.

Sat Oct 17 02:43:21 EDT 1998 Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* tree.h, tree.c: Ok, the main objects in the tree will be native
	  corba objects, it costs 8 bytes per Node, Attribute and Document
	  but it simplifies the Corba integration a lot (no extra interface
	  objects to allocate/free).

Tue Oct 13 21:46:57 EDT 1998 Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* tree.h, tree.c, parser.c: added prev and doc pointers to Node,
	  and changed NODEs contants for conformity with DOM Level 1

Wed Oct  7 23:42:46 EDT 1998 Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* added hooks to keep track of servants when creating objects
	  xmlDoc and xmlNode (for Corba export).

	  to autoupdate libtool and automake conf files.

1998-09-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am: Use '?' to separate the sed
	commands as ',' is used when people pass -Wl,something.


Thu Sep 24 15:13:29 EDT 1998 Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* tree.c, tree.h: added a per-document compression interface.

Tue Sep 22 20:47:38 EDT 1998

	* tree.c, tree.h: added saving with compression and added interfaces
	  to control the compression level (xmlGetCompressMode,
	  xmlSetCompressMode) and a new save to filename function (xmlSaveFile).

Mon Sep 21 20:11:13 EDT 1998 Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* parser.c: corrected a loop for files of size 0

1998-08-20  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* error.h: New file.  Contains prototyes from `error.c'.

Thu Aug 13 19:02:34 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (xmlincdir): New macro.
	(xmlinc_HEADERS): Renamed from include_HEADERS.

Thu Aug 13 00:40:14 EDT 1998  Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* applied small patch on numeric entities from
	  Christopher Blizzard <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

Wed Aug 12 23:12:58 EDT 1998  Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>

	* New release 0.2, removed the old xml_* files so that it's
	    coherent with the other CVS base (W3C), far better conformance
	    to standard, new namespaces, decent entities support, beginning
	    of a SAX-like interface. Nearly nothing left intact, even the
	    test examples ...

1998-07-30  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add .deps dir

Sun Jul 26 17:29:52 EDT 1998  Daniel Veillard <Daniel.Veillard@w3.org>
